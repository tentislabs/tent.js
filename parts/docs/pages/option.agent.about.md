# `about` of `agent`

One sentence on what the agent is for.

## Value

Text. It is required when the agent is a tool of another one. Left out, it has no sentence.

What it holds is told to everyone a tool is shown to: the model of every starter alike, the list of MCP, and the docs of the API. So it holds nothing secret.

## Example

```ts
export const helper = agent('helper', {
  model: embedder,
  instructions: 'You help with notes.',
  tools: [countNotes, { tool: nightly, tries: 2, about: 'Tidies up at once', line: false, name: 'tidyNow' }],
  limits: { steps: 12, perRun: { tokensOut: 50000 }, time: '10 minutes', ask: '7 days', result: '1 MB', toolCalls: 100, toolsAtOnce: 8, pass: '5 seconds' },
  about: 'Answers questions about notes',
})
```
